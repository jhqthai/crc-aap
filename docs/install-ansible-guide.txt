1. Install epel release to install ansible
sudo dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

2. Install ansible
sudo dnf install ansible
sudo dnf install  --enablerepo epel-playground ansible #try this line if above line doesnt work

3. Configure ansible host 
vi /etc/ansible/hosts

4. Configure ansible.cfg to disable host_key_checking to not having to log in everytime on host [optional] - This should not be done in production insecure
vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
# uncomment 
host_key_checking = False

5. Set up key in both servers

Note:
Ansible is an agentless engine. Relies on ssh to connect to its target.

- Ensure that python is installed on client node.
